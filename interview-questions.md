# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is used to store code to reuse;

  Researched answer: A JS function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task



2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: map is used to go through each element of an array and run a function on it.
  filter is used to filter out criteria and possibly reduces the array

  Researched answer: map - the provided callback to map modifies the array element and save them into the new array upon completion that array get returned as the mapped array.

  filter - filter does not update the existing array it will return a new filtered array everytime.



3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() - is used to print out working code to check if your code works or to see whats happening
  while return is used to output a value from a function.

  Researched answer: console.log() is a function used to printo information to the console.
  return on the other hand is a call to pass some value back up to where the call was made.



4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer: An argument is what you place in your function to execute.

  Researched answer: arguments - it is provided in the argument field of the function.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: two roles you have:
   driver - the job of the driver is to control what is placed on the text editor they look for the next step in a given problem.
   navigator - to oversee the driver and map out what to do next, they check for syntax errors and try to steer driver in right direction by asking the driver their thought process and provide input when needed.

  Researched answer: As the name implies, pair programming is where two developers work using only one machine. Each one has a keyboard and a mouse. One programmer acts as the driver who codes while the other will serve as the observer who will check the code being written, proofread and spell check it, while also figuring out where to go next. These roles can be switched at any time: the driver will then become the observer and vice versa.



6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer: had to look up, didn't even know what it stood for. 
  TDD is test-driven-development

  Researched answer: 
  
  TDD- approach first, the test is developed which specifies and validates what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases are created before code is written. The purpose of TDD is to make the code clearer, simple and bug-free.

  Test-Driven Development starts with designing and developing tests for every small functionality of an application. TDD instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed. This avoids duplication of code. The full form of TDD is Test-driven development.



7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Honestly everything, I really like that the instructors are open to trying out methods that students request and solving it their way, or finding a better approach. Also I'm starting to get used to pair programming. I think it will help me communicate my code out loud better, I feel like I understand how the code works, but when I try to explain it I have a hard time verbalizing my thought process, so I feel like for me to prove to myself that I fully understand what I'm doing. I should be able to explain my code thoroughly. 

  Thanks instructors you guys rock! :)



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React: is a library for building user interface
- Yarn: it is a packet manager for code, it allows the use of sharing JS code with other developers around the world.
- React State: react has a built-in state object. state is where you store property values that belong to the component.
- CRUD: create, read, update, and delete. Commonly used to construct web apps
- this: this refrences the object itself in its scope.
